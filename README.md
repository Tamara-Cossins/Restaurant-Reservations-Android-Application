# Dockside Delight :ocean:

## Background 
A native Android application designed for handling customer reservations for the seaside restaurant Dockside Delight. Provides customers with the ability to create an account, view available tables, book reservations with chosen details, edit reservations, view the restaurant menu, view previous bookings and submit restaurant review and app feedback.

## System Architecture
The application was built using a combination of structural and behavioural design patters where appropriate. This included the usage of Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) hence leverages the strengths of both patterns by effectively segregating different aspects of the application's logic. 

Additional design patterns including Singleton, Adapter, Observer, Factory are implemented to contribute to a well-structured, maintainable and modular application.
